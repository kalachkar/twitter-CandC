To install pip, securely download get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py):

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    
Inspect get-pip.py for any malevolence. Then run the following:

    python get-pip.py

The easiest way to install all the requirments to run the script
is by using pip/easy_install to pull it from PyPI:
    
    git clone https://github.com/kalachkar/twitter-CandC.git
    cd twitter-CandC/
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Python 3.5/3.6 are supported.


To run ipToemoji.py:

    python3 ipToEmoji.py <trend number> <ip address>
    e.g. python3 ipToEmoji.py 1 192.168.1.123

I've used the following repositories:

1- TWINT - Twitter Intelligence Tool (https://github.com/haccer/twint)
python3 ipToEmoji.py 1 192.168.1.123
2- Tweepy: Twitter for Python! (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
